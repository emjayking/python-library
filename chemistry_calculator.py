# purpose: calculate the mass, molar mass and mols of a molecule when given an equation and another molecule. I might try do this with tkinter so I can ue it for the Level 3 GUI project.

# planning

# dictionary of all elements and their relative molecular mass

# ask user for balanced equation

    # develop way of checking if equation is balanced

# Ask for the mass of the first molecule

# calculate the molecular mass (M) of the molecule

# convert mass to mols (n = m / M)

# Ask for the second molecule (use function from first molecule?)

# find molar ratio of first to second molecule

# calculate mols of second molecule

# convert mols to mass (m = M * n)

# print(results)
